# Overview
I wrote this program to demonstrate the knowledge and skills gained from studying Python, Django, and web app development. This program can be run on your device by downloading all files into a folder, opening a command prompt while in the same folder as "manage.py" and typing "python manage.py runserver". Then simply copy and paste the local web address into a browser of your choosing.

# Web Pages

The three pages are a register (user creation page), login (authentication page), and to-do lists that are meant to only be accessible by their individual creator accounts. They automatically transfer between each other within the creation/logging in process but can also be accessed by some of the built in buttons and links (such as "create an account" link from login page.


# Development Environment

Python 3.10.4
Visual Studio Code
Please ensure you install Django and Crispy Forms before running this program.


# Useful Websites
